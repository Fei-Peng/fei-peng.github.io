Hello and welcome!
=========

I am the Director of Engineering at [Optimized Markets][om], where we provide technology to advertising companies so they can match ads to their users (you and I!) in an optimal way.

Before joining OM full-time, I spent two years as a Research Associate in the [Electronic Marketplaces Laboratory][lab] of the [Computer Science Department][csd] at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. While at CMU, I worked with Dr. [Tuomas Sandholm][sandholm] on an NSF grant to develop technologies behind OM.

[//]: # (Tuomas is also the founder and CEO of OM.)

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in Operations Research from the [Industrial and Operations Engineering Department][ioe] at the [University of Michigan][um], where I was fortunate enough to be advised by Drs. [Edwin Romeijn][romeijn] and [Marina Epelman][epelman]. I received the IOE Bonder fellowship for applied Operations Research while I was there.

My work falls in the general areas of Optimization and Artificial Intelligence, with applications in advertising and healthcare. I recently developed lots of interest in Machine Learning. For more detail, please refer to my [publications][pub].

I am generally interested in entrepreneurship and startup ideas both in the US and in China.

My [Erdős number][erdos] is 4:
